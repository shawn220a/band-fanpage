        <!-- Band's Bio -->

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            MercyMe started back in 1994 at Henderson Baptist Church in Edmond, Oklahoma. The lead singer lost his father his first year of college and he moved to Lakeland, Florida for a fresh start. He befriended the keyboardist Bryson at the local church. The two of them travel to Europe as a praise team and then moved to Oklahoma. They then relocated to Dallas, Texas and formed the rest of the group. The team has been touring the world since then and have been to many award shows. The band has 12 records and their latest came out in 2017 and it is called Lifer. They have also been nominated for the Grammy, Dove, American Music, and Billboard Music Awards. They have only won multiple awards in the Dove and American Music Awards.
